A website and framework for testing NIDS detection

## PCAP or it didn't happen!

One of the features that is made available from *tmNIDS* is the download and replay of PCAP's *(network packet captures)*. This folder will host all captures that are used in the tests, allowing you to see exactly what the test is doing. All the captures available under this project have been edited to remove any PII, and you are free to use them as part of the tests or any other activity for which they might be useful. 

## Active malware

Even though we could use captures from recent or ongoing malware campaigns or active CnC servers, this is not the purpose of the project. There are many malware sharing projects that will allow you to get this data. 

**The captures available here are NOT malicious and do not contact active or dangerous services or websites.**
